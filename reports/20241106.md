This week, our group worked on understanding and initializing the GitHub repos and starting basic coding and UI setup for our website. We will have to keep working on this and accelerate our pace of work to finish basic class swap function by the Beta Release.
On the main part, we have created two documentation files (USER_DOCUMENTATION.d and DEVELOPER_DOCUMENTATION.md) to make progress with user and developer documentation, writing down the necessary guidelines for both users and developers.
Also, we finalized our shared document revision to submit for our "Implementation and Documentation" Canvas Assignment by reducing the detailed overlap between Software Design and Software Architecture, trimming down the unnecessary overlap.
