Second Subsection:

For this week, our group worked on the new Assignment 'SoftWare Design', modifying our HuskySwap shared Document.
For this week's assignment, we had two goals: revising the shared document based on previous feedback on Canvas and adding a new section titled 'Software Design'.
We had trouble with the Process description part, where we had to specify the possible risks for our assignment (which was considered 'vague' from previous feedback) and provide specific descriptions for each software component.
During this assignment, we had valuable time to write out the specific progress of our project, listing a specific design and coding map that we can refer to when we start coding this or next week.
