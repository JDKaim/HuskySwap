First Weekly Report - Empty

Second Subsection:
******************
For this week, our group worked on the new Assignment 'SoftWare Design', modifying our HuskySwap shared Document.
For this week's assignment, we had two goals: revising the shared document based on previous feedback on Canvas and adding a new section titled 'Software Design'.
We had trouble with the Process description part, where we had to specify the possible risks for our assignment (which was considered 'vague' from previous feedback) and provide specific descriptions for each software component.
During this assignment, we had valuable time to write out the specific progress of our project, listing a specific design and coding map that we can refer to when we start coding this or next week.

The third subsection should outline your plans and goals for the following week.
Each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate.
You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task. No bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days.
If a task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to have insight into progress.
If tasks from one week aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.

For the team report, this third subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks.
Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.
