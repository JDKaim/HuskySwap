For this week, our group worked on the new Assignment 'Testing and Continuous Integration', modifying our HuskySwap shared Document.
For this week's assignment, we had two goals: revising the shared document based on previous feedback on Canvas and adding a new section titled 'Testing and Continuous Integration'.
The main trouble came from understanding what we had to change based on the feedback, as the feedback was quite hard to understand and implement: 'Low-level requirement of software architecture' and 'Alternative Software Architectures'.
We established a basic website with a login page, initializing the foundation of our coding for both the front end and the back end.
