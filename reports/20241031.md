For this week, our group worked on the new Assignment 'Testing and Continuous Integration', modifying our HuskySwap shared Document.
For this week's assignment, we had two goals: revising the shared document based on previous feedback on Canvas and adding a new section titled 'Testing and Continuous Integration'.
For the revision part, the main trouble we faced was making our software architecture more low-level, rather than just the frontend/backend difference.
Also, we have made edits to the risk assessment part, removed the email verification that adds unnecessary requirements, and changed our schedule into a weekly-basis work.

We established a basic website with a login page, initializing the foundation of our coding for both the front end and the back end.
